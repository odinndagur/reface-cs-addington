    //customizable which midi messages get sent with lfo (pitch bend, cc messages)

Map velocity to VCA/VCF
    JJ Mifsud For my Reface CS I just wish you could assign Velocity to VCA or VCF. In the end I automate that in my DAW via CC but still...
Map expression pedal to different things
    Ryan Slotnick It'd be great if you could assign different functions to your expression pedal
Pitch bend thing in the beginning of notes
    Able to set how far the pitch bend goes and how long it takes to get back
        JB Quinn Some of the original CS, SY, and YC series synths had an unusual but cool feature. A switch would cause the pitch of every subsequent note and chord to bend up to the target from a semitone below (the bend speed was adjustable). This can be briefly simulated on the Reface by turning the chorus off and on while playing, so it appears that this feature does exist in our synths, but is not fully implemented.
        The effect can clearly be heard on Eddie Jobson's CS80 during the UK song "Alaska". The first high chords have the bend switch turned on.
        This would be an amazing addition to the CS, if possible.




LATER add audio based stuff (teensy)

Filip Skakun: A better looper with stutter, tremolo and other push button effects

Daniel Heslop: I sometimes wish it had a separate noise source so you could mix it with the other waveforms or have only noise without any pitched waveform. Also more waveforms in the LFO would be nice.
